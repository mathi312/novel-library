# NovelLibrary

This is a angular webpage that displays my epubs and allows me to read them. Besides reading epubs the upload of them is also possible through this side.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
